# COVID-19 Trend Analysis: Power BI Dashboard and Python Insights
This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing global and country-specific COVID-19 trends from 2020-2024, encompassing cases, deaths, and vaccinations. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to extract key insights and drive data-driven visualizations. The dashboard provides stakeholders with comprehensive analyses including total cases and deaths, temporal and regional trends, and vaccination insights to support informed decision-making.

# Functions on the dashboard
- Select specific who regions and periods to access community case that and vaccination numbers.
- Utilisation of different charts to identify the Trends and the countries most affected during a particular period.
# Insights
- During the initial stages of the pandemic (around 2020) the death rate was the highest, reaching approximately 10%,despite the relatively lower number of cases.
- The most challenging period worldwide was towards the end of 2021 and the first three months of 2022.In terms of specific countries the United States, India and China had the highest commulative case counts, which can be attributed to their large populations and expansive territories.
- China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are on the list of top 10 countries with the cases but not in the list of the top 10 countries with the highest deaths.
- On the other hand countries like Mexico, peeru and the Russian Federation are in the list of top 10 countries with highest number of deaths reported but not having high cases.
# Conclusion:
- The global response to COVID-19 demonstrates diverse trends in both the pandemic’s impact and the vaccination rollout. The distribution of cases and deaths reveals interesting disparities: countries like **China**, **Japan**, and **the Republic of Korea** have high case numbers but relatively fewer deaths, whereas **Mexico** and **Peru** exhibit high death tolls with fewer reported cases. These variations may stem from differences in healthcare systems, reporting practices, and public health strategies.

- In terms of vaccination efforts, **China**, **India**, and **the USA** lead in the total number of vaccinated individuals, while the **WPRO** region stands out with the highest percentage of vaccinated people. Despite slow early progress, a noticeable surge in vaccination rates in early 2023 signals a more coordinated global effort, likely driven by improved vaccine availability, policy changes, and mass vaccination drives.

- These insights highlight the complexity of the global pandemic response. Challenges in vaccine distribution, healthcare infrastructure, and public health policy have influenced the outcomes. While some countries and regions have made significant strides in vaccinating their populations, others have faced more obstacles. As the pandemic continues, tailored approaches are crucial for addressing these disparities, improving vaccination coverage, and managing both the health impacts and vaccination efforts effectively.
